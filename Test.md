# A simple file for me to play

This is it, I am learning Git...

I hope to be able to use this correctly.

Very well, I am cooking now...

A simple equation:

$$E=mc^2$$

OK, well.  The objective of this is to play around with Markdown files, learn git, etc.  I'd also like to use Pandoc here.  Quarto can wait a while...

## On learning git and git hub

I am using a free open platform to learn: [Openclassrooms](https://openclassrooms.com/en/) where I queried for a git and git hub course.  That was it...

Now, why git? what's its purpose?  To be able to keep control of software versions.

## Local and remote repositories

- **Local:** My computer.
- **Remote:** The cloud or a server with my code history and folders and such...

The following platforms have remote repositories to host your projects:

1. [GitHub](https://github.com/)
2. [GitLab](https://about.gitlab.com)
3. [Bitbucket](https://bitbucket.org)

Not too bad, so far so good... I have understood everything.  But I need to do more...

I am using github and I am already working with it.

Opening a github account is as easy as visiting and following the instructions of [github's website](https://github.com) No big deal.  I even used my gmail account to work with this.

The remaining piece of software comes from [git's website](https://git-scm.com) (not to be confused with github: github is a repository and git is a version control system.)  Now, this is also easy and what you will get is git and git bash which is another command interface.
